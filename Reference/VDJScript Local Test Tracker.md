# VDJScript Local Test Tracker

Focused manual-test log for verbs marked **Needs local test** in [Official VDJScript Coverage Audit](Official%20VDJScript%20Coverage%20Audit.md). Keep rows practical: one reproducible check, the VirtualDJ build, hardware/context, result, and any follow-up notes.

Result values: `Untested`, `Pass`, `Partial`, `Fail`, `N/A`.

## Controller Display

| Verb | Why local test | Likely surface/context | Suggested minimal repro | VirtualDJ build | Hardware | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `controllerscreen_deck` | Sparse official prose; likely depends on controller screen routing and deck assignment. | Controller mapping with display-capable device; possibly screen page/action context. | Map a spare button/display action to `deck 1 controllerscreen_deck`, then repeat on deck 2 and observe whether the controller screen follows or reports the selected deck. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `controller_battery` | Hardware/environment dependent; useful only on devices that expose battery state. | Controller mapping, wireless/battery-capable controller display or LED feedback. | With a battery-capable controller connected, bind/display `` `controller_battery` `` and compare against the device/OS battery indicator while plugged and unplugged. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `gemini_waveform_zoomlevel` | Gemini-specific helper; behavior likely only visible on supported Gemini displays. | Gemini controller display/waveform mapping. | On supported Gemini hardware, bind `gemini_waveform_zoomlevel +1` and `-1`; verify waveform zoom changes and persists/display updates as expected. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |

| `rzx_touch` | Pioneer RZX touchscreen helper; requires RZX touch surface. | Pioneer RZX mapping, touch/display context. | On RZX hardware, display/log `` `rzx_touch` `` while touching and releasing the screen; confirm boolean/timing behavior. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `rzx_touch_x` | RZX-specific X coordinate helper; coordinate range is unknown locally. | Pioneer RZX touch/display mapping. | Touch left, center, and right of the RZX screen while logging `` `rzx_touch_x` ``; record min/max and origin. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `rzx_touch_y` | RZX-specific Y coordinate helper; coordinate range is unknown locally. | Pioneer RZX touch/display mapping. | Touch top, center, and bottom of the RZX screen while logging `` `rzx_touch_y` ``; record min/max and origin. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `djc_shift` | DJC-family helper; shift behavior may be controller/mapping specific. | DJC controller mapping. | On supported DJC hardware, bind/display `` `djc_shift` `` and press/release the hardware shift; confirm scope and latch/hold behavior. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `djc_button` | DJC-family button helper; argument/value behavior is sparse. | DJC controller mapping/button feedback. | Bind `djc_button` to a test control and observe UI/LED/display response; repeat with likely button indexes if the mapping exposes them. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `djc_button_popup` | DJC popup helper; expected popup/menu target needs confirmation. | DJC controller mapping with screen/menu controls. | Trigger `djc_button_popup` from a spare mapping button; note whether it opens a menu, affects a selected DJC button, or requires parameters. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `djc_button_slider` | DJC slider-button helper; hardware control semantics need confirmation. | DJC controller mapping with slider/button controls. | Bind `djc_button_slider` to an encoder/slider test control and observe any display or selection changes. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `djc_button_select` | DJC selection helper; likely navigates or commits a hardware-menu choice. | DJC controller mapping/menu context. | Open any DJC-related menu/popup, trigger `djc_button_select`, and record whether it selects, cycles, or toggles an item. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `djc_panel` | DJC panel helper; target panel names/states are not locally verified. | DJC controller display/panel mapping. | Trigger `djc_panel` from a spare button and, if needed, try known panel identifiers from the stock mapping; record visible panel changes. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |
| `denon_platter` | Denon-specific platter action/helper; platter LED/display behavior depends on device family. | Denon controller/player mapping; platter display feedback. | On supported Denon hardware, bind `denon_platter` and compare with `` `get_denon_platter` `` while playing, cueing, scratching, and changing deck assignment. | TBD | TBD | Untested | TBD |

## System And Config Helpers

| Verb | Why local test | Likely surface/context | Suggested minimal repro | VirtualDJ build | Hardware | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `connect` | Official skins use it, but action/query behavior varies by account connection state. | Skin button, custom button, config/account UI. | Test logged out and logged in: run `connect`, then display/query `` `connect` `` if accepted; record opened UI and returned state. | TBD | None required | Untested | TBD |
| `system` | Sparse official system helper; parameters and return behavior are unclear. | Custom button, skin query/text, possible system integration context. | Run `system` with no parameter in a custom button; then try a harmless known/obvious parameter only if official examples are found; record UI/log output. | TBD | None required | Untested | TBD |
| `open_stem_creator` | Opens a workflow that may depend on license/build/stem features. | Skin/custom button, config/workflow action. | Run `open_stem_creator` with a track selected and with no track selected; note opened window, gating, and any error/status message. | TBD | None required | Untested | TBD |

## Deck And Mode Helpers

| Verb | Why local test | Likely surface/context | Suggested minimal repro | VirtualDJ build | Hardware | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dualdeckmode_decks` | Official prose ties it to dual-deck pairs 1/3 or 2/4, but mapping behavior is sparse. | Controller mapping, deck assignment logic, dual-deck mode. | Enable `dualdeckmode`, load decks 1/3 and 2/4, then display/log `` `dualdeckmode_decks` `` from each deck context; record pair selection and false states. | TBD | Optional controller | Untested | TBD |

## Karaoke

| Verb | Why local test | Likely surface/context | Suggested minimal repro | VirtualDJ build | Hardware | Result | Notes |

| `karaoke_venue_name` | Sparse karaoke helper; source of value and empty-state behavior need confirmation. | Karaoke skin text/query, karaoke options/config. | Set/clear the venue name in karaoke options, display `` `karaoke_venue_name` ``, and record value, fallback text, and whether changes update live. | TBD | None required | Untested | TBD |
